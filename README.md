# How to create an Astro project with Tailwind using this template

## Step 1: Clone the template

Run the following command in your terminal to create a new project based on the template:

> ⚠️  (Remember to replace “new-project” with the name of your project)

```bash
npx degit BracoZS/astro_tailwind_4-template new-project
```
This will download the base project to the “new-project” folder

## Step 2: Enter the project folder

```bash
cd new-project
```

## Step 3: Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Done!

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
